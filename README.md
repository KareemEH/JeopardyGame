# Jeopardy Game
This repository contains a customized version of a Jeopardy game that I created for entertainment purposes with my friends. I wanted to develop a personalized Jeopardy game with custom questions and categories, but couldn't find an existing solution online that met my desired functionality.
The primary reason for hosting this project on my GitHub is to serve as a nostalgic reminder of where it all began. It's a pleasant experience to look back and appreciate the progress I've made in programming since its inception.

## Key Points
* This project was created during my third year of high school and is my first personal programming project.
* Please note that this code is not meant to be exemplary or a reflection of my current programming abilities. It holds sentimental value to me personally.
* The project was implemented using the Python Tkinter library.

## How to Run
* If, for any reason, you wish to use this project, simply run the jeopardy.py with python installed.
* To modify the categories, questions, and answers, open the jeopardy.py file and make the desired changes to the corresponding string values.
