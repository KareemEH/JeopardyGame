# Jeopardy Game
This is a rendition of a customizable jeopardy game that I made to enjoy with my freinds.
The main reason this project resides on my github is to serve as a reminder to myself of where it all began.

## Things to Note
* This project was made in in my third year of highschool, and was my first ever solo personal project.
* Project was made using the python Tkinter library.

## How to run
* If you do decide (for whatever reason) to use this all you have to do is run the jeopardy.py file.
* In order to change the categories, questions and answers you have to go into the jeopardy.py file and change the string values as you wish.
